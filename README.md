# Evidential Deep Learning

### "All models are wrong, but some [*that know when they can be trusted*] are useful!"

This repository contains the code to reproduce the recent NeurIPS submissions [Deep Evidential Regression](http://www.mit.edu/~amini/pubs/pdf/deep-evidential-regression.pdf) as well as more general code to leverage evidential learning to train neural networks to learn their own measures of uncertainty directly from data!

**Code is coming soon! and will be published when the paper is presented during the [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc/) conference.**
